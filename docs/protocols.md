# Meeting Protocols

## Nov. 20 2018

1. We brainstormed the following ideas: classifying music genres from billboard songs, generating new possibly cheesy song lyrics, making tools to convert simple text into fancy text, making tools to help prevent people from plagiarizing

2. We all really liked the idea of generating cheesy or nice songs based on the personality of a person. We could make some inferences on the personality using the Twitter API given the user's twitter username. We also wanted to implement a Telegram bot to communicate this song with the user. This is where we stopped.

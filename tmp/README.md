# tmp directory

Feel free to use this directory to store your local intermediate files. It is advisable not to push these to GitHub, ie. best to leave this directory empty. You can do so by creating a `.gitignore` file here. Note, the `.gitignore` file at the root of this repository already excludes certain file types.
